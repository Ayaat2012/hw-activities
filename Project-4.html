                <h2>Facts about cats</h2>
                <p>
                    The cat (scientific name: 𝑭𝒆𝒍𝒊𝒔 𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒔 ) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from its wild members . [ 3 ] A cat can be either a house cat , a farm cat , or a feral cat ; wild cats freely avoid human contact. [ 4 ] Domestic cats are valued by humans for their companionship and ability to hunt small mammals.<br>
                    Cats are anatomically similar to other felid species: they have strong flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws that are adapted for killing small prey. Their vision and sense of smell are well-developed at night. Cat communication includes a variety of vocalizations such as meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting, as well as cat-specific body language. Although cats are a social species, they are solitary hunters. As hunters, they are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk. They can hear frequencies that are too faint or too high for the human ear, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. [ 5 ] They can also secrete and perceive pheromones [6]Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. [ 7 ] Domestic cats are bred and shown as registered pedigree cats in various countries, a hobby that is popular with cat lovers. Cat populations can be controlled artificially by spaying and neutering, but their spread and abandonment of pets have led to large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.
